\section{Introduction}
Mixers are three-port devices (\Cref{fig:mixer}) that produce sum and difference frequencies of the two supplied input frequencies.
They have wide applications including use as modulators, phase detectors, and product detectors.

    \end{circuitikz}

Typically, one of the inputs to the mixer is a local oscillator (LO), and for down conversion, the other input signal is called RF, and the output is called IF (intermediate frequency).

In this lab we build a diode-ring mixer, and test its various characteristics.
The diode-ring mixer is a passive, double balanced mixer.
The passive design allows for greater bandwidth, at the cost of greater conversion loss;
and the double balanced design provides great RF and LO suppression.

    \caption{Circuit of Double Balanced Diode Ring Mixer}
    \label{fig:mixer_circuit}
\end{figure}

We build the double balanced diode ring mixer according to \Cref{fig:mixer_circuit}.
It consists of two transformers and a diode ring.
The ring diode used is \href{https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-BAT15-099R-DS-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d46265f064ff0166389632964e8c}{BAT15-099R}, which can be used in these mixers for up to 12GHz in frequency.
The RF transformers are \href{https://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/ADT4-1WT+.pdf}{ADT4-1WT+}, which work from 2 to 775 MHz.
Here, the transformers are used as baluns, which convert between balanced and unbalanced signals.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Overall Performance}
To test our mixer, we drove both the LO and RF inputs at 0dBm, and set RF frequency to 10MHz, and LO frequency to 7.1MHz.
The output spectrum from 0Hz to 40MHz is shown in \Cref{fig:mixer_out}, where the sum and difference frequencies, as well as the most prominent intermodulation distortions are marked by texts.

    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, transform shape]
        \node[anchor=south west, inner sep=0] (X) at (0,0){\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./pics/mixer_out_RF10_LO7_1.jpg}};% 
        \node[annotation] at (3, 6) {RF-LO\\2.9MHz};
        \node[annotation] at (5.3, 6) {RF+LO\\17.1MHz};
        \node[annotation] at (7.65, 5.7) {RF+3LO\\31.3MHz};
        \node[annotation] at (4.36, 5.7) {-RF+3LO\\11.3MHz};
        \node[annotation] at (8.60, 5.7) {3RF+LO\\37.1MHz};
        \node[annotation] at (6.27, 5.7) {3RF-LO\\22.9MHz};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Spectrum of Mixer Output. LO=RF=0dBm.}
    \label{fig:mixer_out}
\end{figure}

From the figure, we can see that both the sum (17.1MHz) and different (2.9MHz) frequencies are at least 20dB above the intermodulation distortions, which means our mixer mixes the two inputs pretty well.
In addition, the LO leakage is virtually non-existent -- well below -50dB at 7.1MHz.

Interestingly, at this level of input, the highest spurs occur at $3RF\pm LO$ and $3LO \pm RF$.
These are all fourth-order intermodulations, with odd orders for both the RF and the LO components.
We hypothesize that this particular diode-ring mixer network suppresses intermodulations when either the RF or the LO has even orders.
To validate this hypothesis, we lowered RF to -10dBm, while keeping LO at 0dBm.
The results are shown in \Cref{fig:mixer_out_2}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, transform shape]
        \node[anchor=south west, inner sep=0] (X) at (0,0){\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./pics/mixer_out_RF10_LO7_1_2.jpg}};% 
        \node[annotation] at (2.85, 6.2) {RF-LO\\2.9MHz};
        \node[annotation] at (5.43, 6.2) {RF+LO\\17.1MHz};
        \node[annotation] at (8.09, 6.2) {RF+3LO\\31.3MHz};
        \node[annotation] at (4.41, 6.2) {-RF+3LO\\11.3MHz};
        \node[annotation] at (7.00, 6) {-RF+5LO\\25.5MHz};
        \node[annotation] at (9.44, 6) {8RF-13LO\\39.7MHz};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Spectrum of Mixer Output. LO=0dBm, RF=-10dBm.}
    \label{fig:mixer_out_2}
\end{figure}

In this case, the biggest intermodulations are at $3LO\pm RF$, $5LO-RF$, and something at 39.7MHz, which seems to be $8RF-13LO$.
The $5LO-RF$ still confirms our hypothesis of the mixer suppressing even orders of LO and RF.
The component at 39.7MHz is quite weird, and we have no idea why this intermodulation would be so big.

\subsection{Conversion Gain and 1dB Compression Point}
An important performance metric of mixers is the conversion gain, defined as the power level of the IF output minus the power level of the RF input in dBs.
Ideally, the conversion gain would be constant at all RF input levels.
However, for real mixers, as the RF input power increases, the IF output power cannot keep up with the increase in input.
The point where the ideal output power is 1dB lower than the actual output power is called the 1dB compression point.
Operating below the 1dB compression point guarantees good linearity between the input and the output of the mixer;
so little distortion is introduced to the signal.

We measured the 1dB compression point and gain when LO=0dBm by stepping the RF input power from -10dBm to 0dBm.
The results are plotted in \Cref{fig:rf_if}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./pics/1db_compression.png}
    \caption{RF Input Power vs IF Output Power (LO=0dBm)}
    \label{fig:rf_if}
\end{figure}

From the figure, we can see that under -4dBm, the relationship between input power and output power (in dBs) is very linear, with gain around $-6.5dB$.
Ideally, the diode ring passive mixer would equally divide all the input power between the sum and the difference frequencies in the output.
So we would expect to see a gain of $-6dB$ for both.
The $0.5dB$ discrepancy between the measured $-6.5dB$ and the theoretical $0.5dB$ is probably due to non-ideal componenents.

However, above $-4dBm$, the ideal response and actual response start to differ, and we reach the 1dB compression point around $-0.5dBm$.

\subsection{Conversion Gain vs LO Drive Level}
To measure the dependance of conversion gain on LO Drive Level, we measured the conversion gain with LO drive level from -5dBm to 3dBm.
Since the conversion gain is more actually measured at low RF levels, we kept RF input at -10dBm, and calculated the gain as
\[ \text{IF output level} + 10dBm.
\]
The results are plotted in \Cref{fig:lo_gain}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{./pics/lo_gain.png}
    \caption{Dependance of Conversion Gain on LO Drive Level}
    \label{fig:lo_gain}
\end{figure}

From the plot, we can see that at low LO levels, the gain increases by almost 1dB for every 1dB increase in LO level.
At high LO levels, the conversion gain becomes insensitive to the LO level, and almost reaches the theoretical -6dBm.

This behavior is both expected and desired.
Since the LO just serves to switch RF on and off, when it is high enough, the output should be independent of its value.
In addition, the relative independence of conversion gain on LO drive level allows us to choose a wide range of LO drive levels.

\subsection{Input Intercept Point}
We plotted the magnitude of the fundamental frequencies (sum and difference), as well as the magnitude of the most important spurs at $3RF\pm LO$ and $3LO \pm RF$, when input RF power ranges from -10dBm to 0dBm in \Cref{fig:intercept}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./pics/intercept.png}
    \caption{Magnitude of Components of Output vs Input Power}
    \label{fig:intercept}
\end{figure}

As we can see in the figure, the power (in dB) of spurs at $3LO \pm RF$ grows roughly with slope 1 with input RF power, while that of spurs at $3RF \pm LO$ grows roughly with slope 3 with input RF power (linear regression gives 3.3).

The difference in slope is probably explained by the different orders of RF in the intermodulation component.
In $3LO \pm RF$, RF has order $1$, so power of this component has slope 1 against input RF power;
while in $3RF \pm LO$, RF has order $3$, so power of this component has slope 3.

The predicted power of the $3RF \pm LO$ components roughly intersect the ideal fundamental response when RF input power is 12dBm.
This is a so-called ``Third Order Input Intercept Point''.

\section{Conclusions}
In the lab, we studied the various properties of the diode ring mixer, including conversion gain, 1dB compression point, dependance of conversion gain on LO level, and input intercept point.
This work can be extended by better understanding the power of intermodulations in the diode-ring mixer, both theoretically and practically.
A better model of the mixer would allow us to better choose IF frequency and relevant filters to minimize the influence of intermodulations on the desired output.
